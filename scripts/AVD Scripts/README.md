## Scripts for working with Azure Virtual Desktop

Collection of scripts I have created for working with Azure Virtual Desktop. 


Note that some of these "scripts" aren't meant to be run as a single script but are collections of useful 
commands and code snippets to be run interactively using the ISE or VSC. Some copi;f be but I put a "retiurn" at the top
to avoid any unfortunate mistakes.

The "InstallAndConfigure-*" script files are a set of commands/utilities to customize your image and install common tools.
